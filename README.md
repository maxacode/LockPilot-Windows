## Windows Behavior Notes

- **Lock** uses `LockWorkStation()` Win32 API
- **Shutdown** uses `shutdown /s /t 0`
- **Reboot** uses `shutdown /r /t 0`
- **Popup** uses `MessageBoxW()` Win32 API

## Timer Persistence

Timers are saved to app data (`timers.json`) when created/updated/canceled and restored automatically on app launch.

## Project Layout

- `src-tauri/`: Rust backend + Tauri app config
- `ui/`: static frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Dev Run (no JS framework required)

1. Install Rust and cargo.
2. Install Tauri CLI:
   ```
   cargo install tauri-cli
   ```
3. In one terminal, serve the `ui/` folder:
   ```
   python -m http.server 1420 --directory ui
   ```
4. In another terminal, run:
   ```
   cd src-tauri
   cargo tauri dev
   ```

## Build

From `src-tauri/`:

```
cargo tauri build --bundles nsis
```

Output bundles are under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
